## Question 1
It's different because you have to create the layout by using methods that are not best practices - i.e. tables & inline styling! 
There are also SO many email clients, and because of that we have to use these old methods to make sure that the code is rendered the same on all sites. 

## Question 2
Making sure to use nested tables, keep your img sizes small, size E V E R Y T H I N G, and design for the lowest common denominator first!
